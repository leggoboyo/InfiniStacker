# prep-ios-build-notes

Write clear iOS build instructions based on current project state.

## Scope
- Generate or refresh `docs/IOS_BUILD.md`.
- Cover Unity Player settings, build target, signing, Xcode archive/run, and device verification.
- Keep instructions minimal and deterministic.

## Boundaries
- No cloud CI assumptions.
- No third-party SDK instructions.
- Preserve offline-only constraints.
