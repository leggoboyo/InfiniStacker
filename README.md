# InfiniStacker

Offline, original hyper-casual lane survival shooter prototype in Unity (URP target), inspired by ad-style mechanics only.

## Constraints
- Offline-only runtime (no ads, analytics, telemetry, remote config, IAP).
- Unity 2022.3 LTS baseline.
- Input System for touch + mouse drag.
- TextMeshPro for counters/labels.
- No Asset Store or external dependencies.

## Open And Run
1. Open this folder in Unity Hub using Unity `2022.3 LTS`.
2. Open scene `Assets/Scenes/Game.unity`.
3. Press Play.

If Unity CLI is unavailable, this repo still works through Unity Hub + Editor.

## How To Test (Current Milestone)
### M0
1. Confirm repo contains `.gitignore`, `AGENTS.md`, `BACKLOG.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `.agents/skills/`, and `docs/AUTOMATIONS.md`.
2. Confirm no runtime/gameplay code was introduced in M0.
3. Note: `Assets/Scenes/Game.unity` and gameplay systems are introduced in M1.
